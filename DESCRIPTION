Description: The goal of walkcyclecalcs is to provide functions which can be used to 
    estimate the physical capability of populations of individuals to make journeys 
    by walking or cycling.  This is useful of you want to know things like who could 
    get to work if there was a shock reduction in fuel availability for motor vehicles.  
    It is also useful if you want to understand whether it's reasonable to assume 
    everyone in a community has the physical capability to make use of new cycle 
    infrastructure or could walk to the nearest bus-stop.
