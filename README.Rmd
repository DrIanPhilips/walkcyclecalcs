# walkcyclecalcs

The goal of walkcyclecalcs is to provide functions which can be used to estimate the physical capability of populations of individuals to make journeys by walking or cycling.  This is useful of you want to know things like who could get to work if there was a shock reduction in fuel availability for motor vehicles.  It is also useful if you want to understand whether it's reasonable to assume everyone in a community has the physical capability to make use of new cycle infrastructure or could walk to the nearest bus-stop.  


The following paper provides an explanation and rationale for the functions.  
Philips, I., Watling, D., Timms, P., 2018. Estimating Individual Physical Capability (IPC) to make journeys by bicycle. International Journal of Sustainable Transportation 12. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15568318.2017.1368748


This paper explains how one might generate a synthetic population of individuals so that you can estimate the variety physical fitness attributes that people within a community posess.

The work in the papers began as a PhD Thesis:  
Philips, I., 2014. The potential role of walking and cycling to increase resilience of transport systems to future external shocks. (Creating an indicator of who could get to work by walking and cycling if there was no fuel for motorised transport) (phd). University of Leeds. http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/7349/


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DrIanPhilips/walkcyclecalcs")
```

## Example (Under construction)

This will have a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(walkcyclecalcs)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
